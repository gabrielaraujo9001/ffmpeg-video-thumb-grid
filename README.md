# FFMpeg Video Thumb Grid
Simple PHP tool to create thumbnail grids from video files.

## Installation
This tool does not come with the executable files from FFMpeg, so you need to get them [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html). When the download is complete, copy ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe from the downloaded folder and paste the files into this directory.

## Usage
You can use this tool directly from the browser or through the terminal.
