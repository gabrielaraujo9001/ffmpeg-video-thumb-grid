## Installation
This tool does not come with the executable files from FFMpeg, so you need to get them [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html). When the download is complete, copy ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe from the downloaded folder and paste the files into this directory.

## Configuration
There are some configuration options available in the file `config.php`.

## Usage
You can use this tool directly from the browser or through the terminal by running the following command from the root folder:
```sh
php index.php
```
